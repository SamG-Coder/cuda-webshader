# Chrono SPH dam-break port: native reference and neighbour stages

This is an in-progress compiler port, not a runnable water showcase.

Upstream: https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono at
`a92c6f72f422fbcafe0b37125d4070cb6a3b5803`.
The original `src/demos/fsi/sph/demo_FSI-SPH_DamBreak.cpp` and solver are unchanged.
Chrono's BSD terms are reproduced in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

## Native reference

Built the original `demo_FSI-SPH_DamBreak` target with CUDA 13.3, native GPU
architecture, MSVC 19.51, Release, single precision, and Eigen revision
`549bf8c75b6aae071cde2f28aa48f16ee3ae60b0`. FSI and FSI-SPH are enabled;
FSI-TDPF, tests and optional visualization are disabled. The out-of-source build
is `.local/chrono-build`; the original source is `.local/chrono-upstream`.
MSVC requires `/Zc:preprocessor` for this toolchain.

Executed:

```text
demo_FSI-SPH_DamBreak.exe --no_vis --output --output_fps 2 --quiet
```

The process exited successfully after the original ten simulated seconds
(approximately 100,000 RK2 steps of 0.0001 seconds), taking 157.931 wall seconds.
Only logging, visualization and snapshot frequency were set on the command line.
The simulation contains 16,731 fluid particles. All 20 saved particle snapshots
have the same particle count and finite values in all ten columns. Snapshots
cover t=0 through t=9.5; the last saved snapshot is not the final t=10 state.
`chrono-dambreak-native.json` records per-frame ranges and SHA-256 hashes.
The CSV files are local reference data under
`.local/chrono-native-output/CFD_WCSPH_RK2_ps1/particles/`.
Finite output and process success do not establish agreement with an experimental
fluid benchmark; they establish the native implementation's reference run.

## First compiler issue fixed

`findCellStartEndD` lets individual lanes return before `__syncthreads()`.
WGSL generation succeeded initially, but real NVIDIA WebGPU validation rejected
the non-uniform barrier. `predicatedReturns: true` now lowers supported
straight-line kernel phases: returned lanes still reach top-level barriers,
while subsequent conditions, initializers and memory operations execute only
for active lanes. The CUDA fixture remains unchanged. No uniformity diagnostics
are disabled. Nested barrier control flow, nested returns, non-scalar local
lifetimes and top-level loops are rejected by this bounded option.

`OriginalToSortedD` and `findCellStartEndD` execute on real NVIDIA Blackwell
WebGPU. They agree exactly with the original native CUDA kernels and an
independent cell-span/permutation oracle for 2,936 values across particle counts
0, 1, 31, 127, 128, 129, 255, 256, 257 and 1027. Output sentinels verify that
inactive lanes do not write. This covers full and partial blocks and cell spans
crossing block boundaries; it is not a complete neighbour-search or SPH step.

To regenerate the native kernel reference from a Visual Studio developer shell:

```text
nvcc -O3 -std=c++17 -arch=native -Xcompiler /Zc:preprocessor tests/chrono-neighbors-native.cu -o .local/chrono-neighbors-native.exe
.local/chrono-neighbors-native.exe > reports/chrono-neighbors-native.json
```

Run `npm test`, `npm run compile`, `npm run build`, then `node scripts/test-gpu.mjs`
with `CW_SOFTWARE_GPU=0` and `CW_CHROMIUM` pointing to the installed Edge executable.
The GPU suite includes the native-reference comparison.

## Remaining for the water showcase

Handle Chrono's namespaced types and constant parameter structures, compile the
actual position hashing and neighbour-list kernels, connect sort/scan stages,
then add ADAMI boundary forces, WCSPH pressure/viscosity and RK2 integration.
Compare intermediate buffers and evolved particle states against native CUDA.
Only then wire the full solver to a sandbox preview and add its showcase card.
The native CSV sequence must not stand in for browser computation.
